# KG-Embeddings

~~Repo containing experiments for graph embeddings for two preprints ["Graph Embeddings via Tensor Products and Approximately Orthonormal Codes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10917) and ["Memory and Capacity of Graph Embedding Methods"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08769).~~

Edit: Clean experiment code is provided in the "GETS_experiments" repo.

Also contains proof-of-concept experiment applying those methods to link prediction on the [Freebase knowledge graph dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52312).
